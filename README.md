== Rollcall

Rollcall is a suite of tools for tracking and analysis of school attendance and enrollment records.
Through careful monitoring of attendance records, an epidemiologist can get an early warning of
upcomming flu and other infection disease outbreaks.

=== Rollcall Stand-Alone

Rollcall was formerly part of the openphin platform. In an effort to improve access and adoption, it
has been developed to be its own piece of software. In addition, the stand-alone version provides a
self service portal for school districts and health departments to ease on-boarding new districts
and reducing data-use agreements to 2 party instead of 3 party as formerly negotiated.

=== Disclaimer

Rollcall is open source software. You are free to use and modify the software as needed. It is
provided without warranty or liability. If you want to contribute, open a pull request.
