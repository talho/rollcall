Rollcall
========

This is a plugin for openPHIN.
1) plugins are registerd in the global array $expansion_list
2) javascript and stylesheet files
  - any javascript and stylesheet files for the plugin are registered with
    rails register_javascript_expansion() and register_stylesheet_expansion()
  - the paths must be relative to Rails.root/public
  - the plugin install.rb must make links to the plugin js/css dirs in
    Rails.root/public
3) run cucumber tests for this plugin with 'rake cucumber:rollcall'
4) run spec tests for this plugin with 'bundle exec spec vendor/plugins/rollcall/'

The following was done initially to setup the plugin:
1) edited Rails.root/spec/spec_helper.rb to
  - set fixture path to PLUGIN/spec/fixtures/
  - load PLUGIN/spec/factories.rb
2) Edited PLUGIN/install.rb to create
  - link in Rails.root/public to vendor/plugins/rollcall/public/javascripts
  - link in Rails.root/public to vendor/plugins/rollcall/public/stylesheets
  - link in PLUGIN/spec/spec_helper.rb -> Rails.root/spec/spec_helper.rb
3) Necessary factories were defined in PLUGIN/spec/factories.rb
4) Defined tasks in PLUGIN/tasks/cucumber.rake & PLUGIN/tasks/rspec.rake
5) Defined migrations in PLUGIN/tasks/rollcall_tasks.rake
