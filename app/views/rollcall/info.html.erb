          <h4>What is Rollcall?</h4>
            <p>Rollcall is a web-based epidemiology tool that allows for the tracking and analysis of school absenteeism and, in many areas, syndromic data.</p>
            <p>All data utilized by Rollcall comes from existing daily electronic school reporting software, and allows the user to have access to the organized data, graphed and analyzed data.</p>
          <h4>Features</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Utilizes existing data feeds</li>

              <li>Mapping features</li>
              <li>Alerting features</li>

            </ul>
          <h4>Why Track Attendance?</h4>
            <img src=""/><br/>
            <p>Often times school absenteeism can be the first, measurable indication of a community disease outbreak, appearing well before reportable hospital data can be gathered to indicate an outbreak.</p>
          <h4>Has this been done before?</h4>
            <p>There have been some other attendance tracking tools that have used school absenteeism data for the purpose of surveillance for outbreak.</p>
            <p>However, no tool we have found has been in development for as long as Rollcall, no tool takes in as much data as Rollcall currently does, and not tool has been as easy to use and accessible as Rollcall.</p>

      <h4>History</h4>
      <p>Rollcall began in 2009 as a partnership with the largest local health department in the state of Texas, Houston Department of Health and Human Services (HDHHS), 
        and one of the top ten largest school districts in the nation, the Houston Independent School District (HISD).</p>
      <p>The Rollcall Project was a response to the need for an early warning system for influenza outbreaks in the schools. After H1N1, the project gained a new significance, 
        shifting its focus to near real-time analysis with alarms and syndromic surveillance to provide additional tools to prepare for, detect, and track influenza outbreaks.</p>
      <p>Through 2011 and 2012, we completed our first expansion, covering 20+ school districts, 10+ health departments, and 700+ schools. Current goals include adding 
        additional tools, further increasing ease of use, and streamlining the deployment process with new schools.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tab-pane container-fluid" id="how">
      <h4>How does it work?</h4>
      <p>Setting up a near-real time data feed for Rollcall is as easy as ‘set it and forget it.’</p>
      <p>Most school districts already have centralized attendance software also being used by school nurses to enter in student nurse visits and absentee reasons. We work with those software companies
        to develop an automated script that accesses that data in real-time, being careful to only take de-identified raw data. Once this export is running, the school district no longer needs to worry 
        about reporting influenza-like illness to the health department.</p>
      <p>Then, the data is immediately and always available in Rollcall to be accessed in simple searches, exportable CSVs, and graphing and mapping analysis tools.</p>
      <p>Simple graphing gives those who are only interested in the current status of influenza-like illness and absenteeism a quick and easy way to access and analyze the data. Alarms, when set, can 
        give health departments early warnings from spikes in absenteeism and influenza. Advanced graphing features allow epidemiologists to dig deeper into the numbers to spot patterns and trends.</p>
      <h4>Who uses Rollcall?</h4>
        <p>Our heavy users are mainly local health department epidemiologists and their staff. However, with the appropriate data agreements in place, district nurses, school nurses, and interested 
          parties can be able to access appropriate portions of the data and analysis tools.</p>
        <p>Since our past and continuous development of Rollcall is based on user feedback, we built the application with health departments in mind. Since we released version 2 of Rollcall, health departments have been able 
          to take advantage of Rollcall features that have assisted them in syndromic surveillance and preparedness tasks.</p>
      <h4>What about privacy concerns?</h4>
        <p>Our development team and our users take privacy very seriously. We take all measures possible to scrub the data clean of any identifiable student data such as names and student ID.</p>
        <p>The unidentified syndromic data we do accept involves indicators such as age, zip code, grade, and chief complaint.</p>
